                <h1 class="rainbow-text">The song that took Kanye to fame</h1>
                <p>Through The Wire is a song on his debut album, The College Dropout, where he talks about a nearly fatal car crash he was involved in. The medical workers taking
                    care of Kanye at the time had to put a wire through his jaw, and he made the track about the whole incident. The inspiring story and thoughtful lyrics were really the
                    things that pushed kanye west into the spotlight.

            <h1 class="notsorainbow-text">Controversies</h1>
                <p>Kanye West, in around October 2022, tweeted some pretty bad stuff about jews and anti-semitism. This was followed up by a... carnival of interviews, where he'd just get mad or walk
                    out for the attention of the media. Around a year later, on December 26, 2023, he tweeted out an apology to the Jewish community, about how he is looking to improve himself.
